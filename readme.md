A little experiment of mine to get haptics onto a quest 2

## Future Roadmap

Current parts of the project being worked on:
- Getting WiFi support for wirelessly sending haptic data to the board
- Find a better way of mounting thats not tape
- Build a 3D printed case for everything to fit into (Not sure about this one since I haven't used my printer in like 2 years)
