# Headset Mounted Haptics

A little experiment of mine to get haptics onto a quest 2

[How To](howto.md)

## Future Roadmap

Current parts of the project being worked on:
- ~~Getting WiFi support for wirelessly sending haptic data to the board~~ - Not happening since [pico w crashes when you try and connect to 802.11ac network](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeeperNetwork/comments/tf0491/pico_keeps_freezing_on_wifi/)
- Getting Bluetooth working for wireless support.
- Find a better way of mounting thats not tape
- Build a 3D printed case for everything to fit into (Not sure about this one since I haven't used my printer in like 2 years)
